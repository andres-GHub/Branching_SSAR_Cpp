# Branching_SSAR_Cpp
Cpp code simulating seismicity branching process of the SSAR model presentend in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022314. SSAR_branching.cpp is a heavily modified version of simPL.cpp by Jordi (the former essentially maintains certain structure/skeleton of the latter but SSAR_branching.cpp is a completely different model).
